| Version                                    | Phase         |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| ![](https://jsr.io/badges/@mizu/for/empty) | 23 â€” `TOGGLE` |

Conditionally render an element after a [`*for`](#for) directive.

```html
<article *for="const article of articles"></article>
<p *empty.not *text="`${$generated} results`"></p>
<p *empty><!-- No results.--></p>
```

## Notes

> [!CAUTION]
> Must be placed immediately after an element with a [`*for`](#for) or another [`*empty`](#empty) directive. Elements generated by the [`*for`](#for) directive do not apply to this restriction.

> [!WARNING]
> There is currently no special handling for [`<template>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template) elements, but future versions may introduce specific behavior for these elements.

## Variables

### `$generated: number`

The number of elements generated by the preceding [`*for`](#for) directive. This value may differ from the actual number of iterations processed if conditional directives were applied.

## Modifiers

### `.not[boolean]`

Inverts the condition, rendering the element when at least one element is generated.
