| ------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| ![](https://jsr.io/badges/@mizu/for/empty) | 23 â€” `TOGGLE` |

Conditionally render an element after a [`*for`](#for) directive.

```html
<article *for="const article of articles"></article>
<p *empty.not="" *text="`${$generated} results`"></p>
<p *empty=""><!-- No results.--></p>
```

## Notes

> [!CAUTION]
> Must be defined on an element immediately preceded by another element with either a [`*for`](#for) or [`*empty`](#empty) directive _(elements generated by [`*for`](#for) directive does not apply to this restriction)_.

> [!WARNING]
> There is currently no special handling for [`<template>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template) elements, but future versions may treat them differently.

## Variables

### `$generated: number`

Number of elements actually generated by the matching [`*for`](#for) directive _(this value may differ from the actual number of iterations processed)_.

## Modifiers

### `.not[boolean]`

Invert conditional logic so that the element is rendered when there was at least one generated element.
