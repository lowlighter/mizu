  <summary *mustache>Another web framework? Really? In {{ new Date().getFullYear() }}?</summary>
  <section>
    <p>
      Yes, but hear us out!
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember when building a web page was as simple as writing some HTML, adding a bit of JavaScript, and styling with CSS? <em>mizu.js</em> brings back that simplicity, offering a modern yet flexible approach to web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      By adhering closely to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/The_web_and_web_standards">web standards</a> and embracing the simplicity of plain HTML and JavaScript, <em>mizu.js</em> offers an almost non-existent learning curve. This
      makes it an excellent choice for both beginners and seasoned developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're serving content from your favorite runtime, generating static websites, or creating dynamic pages in the browser, <em>mizu.js</em> adapts to your needs. — All of it without the hassle of bundlers, transpilers, or countless dependencies.
    </p>

  <summary>Why should I use <em>mizu.js</em> over other web frameworks?</summary>
  <section>
    <p>
      We recognize the power and utility of comprehensive frameworks like <a href="https://react.dev">React</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue.js</a>, and <a href="https://angular.dev">Angular</a>. These tools excel at building complex applications and boast large communities
      and ecosystems. However, they can be overwhelming for smaller projects, often requiring a build step and a steep learning curve with their specific syntax and concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lightweight alternatives such as <a href="https://alpinejs.dev">Alpine.js</a> and <a href="https://htmx.org">htmx</a> are also available. While they perform well in the browser, they were often not designed for server-side use, limiting their applicability across different
      scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>mizu.js</em> draws inspiration from all these frameworks but is designed from the ground up to be:
      <ul>
        <li>Flexible<small class="muted">, suitable for single page applications, static websites, interactive websites, and more.</small></li>
        <li>Versatile<small class="muted">, works both client-side and server-side and in the runtime of your choice.</small></li>
        <li>Simple<small class="muted">, close to vanilla JavaScript and HTML and a minimal learning curve.</small></li>
        <li>Customizable<small class="muted">, easily opt-in/opt-out of features.</small></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If all of this sounds appealing to you, then <em>mizu.js</em> might be the right choice for your next project.

  <summary>Does <em>mizu.js</em> use a Virtual DOM?</summary>
  <section>
    <p>
      It depends.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the server-side, <em>mizu.js</em> employs a Virtual DOM to simulate the browser environment. The current implementation leverages <a href="https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom">JSDOM</a>, but you can use any other Virtual DOM library that adheres to web standards.
      Non-compliant implementations may lead to unexpected behaviors.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the client-side, <em>mizu.js</em> interacts directly with the actual DOM. It tracks processed elements and their states using weak references to prevent memory leaks and enhance performance.
