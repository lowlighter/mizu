  <summary>Why yet another JavaScript framework?</summary>
  <section *markdown>
    <p>
      Probably because of the nostalgia for the days when you could just write a simple HTML file, add a bit of JavaScript and CSS and call it a day â€” All of it without having to worry about bundlers, transpilers, millions of dependencies or any of the other complexities that
      come with modern web development.

    <p>
      **mizu.js** provides a unified way to render pages on any side of the stack, and whether you want to render templates on the backend of your choice, make dynamic pages on the frontend, generate static sites, etc. it will adapt to your needs, not the other way around.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're not entirely satisfied with the built-in directives offered, **mizu.js** has been designed to be easily extensible and hackable, allowing you to create your own directives and features with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not dismiss the usefulness of fully-fledged frameworks such as [React](https://react.dev), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) or [Angular](https://angular.dev), but if you seek a simpler approach with vanilla web knowledge, **mizu.js** might be the right choice for you.
