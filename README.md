## 🥢 Why choose **mizu.js**?

### 🍜 Agnostic

Compatible with most JavaScript runtimes and browsers. Templates can be rendered server-side, client-side, or using a mixture of both.

### 🍤 Straightforward

Simply include its [`<script>` or `import` statement](https://mizu.sh/#usage) to get started. No configuration or build steps are required.

### 🍣 Intuitive

Rely on HTML attributes and vanilla JavaScript expressions, no need to learn a new syntax or language.

### 🍱 Customizable

Make your own build using our [custom builder](https://mizu.sh/build) to select specific features and reduce the final build size according to your project's needs, and create your own directives easily through [developer-friendly APIs](https://mizu.sh/#api).
